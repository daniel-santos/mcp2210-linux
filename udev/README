To automatically unbind usbhid from the mcp2210, and bind to the
mcp2210 driver, use the scripts included in this directory.

Copy rebind_sysfs_driver.sh to /usr/local/sbin, set permissions to 0755.
Copy 99_unbind_mcp2210_usbhid.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d.

When you connect the mcp2210, the kernel will attach usbhid, but the
small script will rebind to the proper kernel module, using the

	.../usbdev/driver/unbind
and
	bus/usb/drivers/mcp2210/bind

sysfs attributes.
